# Alternative player for "Archivio La Stampa" (www.archiviolastampa.it)

## What:

Browser extension that offers an alternative player for www.archiviolastampa.it.

Archivio "La Stampa" is a website that contains all editions of the newspaper "La Stampa" from 1867 to the end of 2005

## Why:

The site hosting the content uses Flash Player to interact with the archive.
Flash Player is going to be EOL (End of Life) after December 31 2020 (https://www.adobe.com/it/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html) and the site may be impossible to use for nobody knows how long.

## DISCLAIMER:

This is my first try at a browser extension and I don't think I will make every functionality available, all I'm looking forward to is a way to browse pages and read.
I don't really care about the "binding boxes" around text or the OCR (in some pages it's pretty bad anyway), it's just a project to practice.

## Wanna help?

This is GitHub, feel free to make a pull request.

## More?

What? You think that with the death of Flash Player they'll take down the entire site making the entire content unavailable?
